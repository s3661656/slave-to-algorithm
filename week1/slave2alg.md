In week 1, we learned the concept of generative and parametric design.
 Karen used breakfast/smoothie as an example to explain the parametres and the system of everyday life 
 
 Some of the artworks that interested me are face profiling by Zach Blas and parametric typography. If my skills are advanced later on, I would like to create
 something similar based on their work. I'm interested in both social design or visual aesthetically pleasing design that are interactive with the user.
 
 Unfortunately, I had to leave during the group activity due to personal reason. But thankfully, Karen has posted what we did during the group project. So I was able to get
 a rough idea on where the class is up to.

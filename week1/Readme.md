week 1 observation
</h1>

<p>In week 1, we learned the concept of generative and parametric design. Karen used breakfast/smoothie as an example to explain the parametres and the system of everyday life </p>
<p>I did some basic research on the definition of parametric design and generative design to grasp a better understanding of the defintition.</p>
<p> web defintion for Parametric Design:
 Parametric Design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameteres and rules that,together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response.</p>
 <p> Whereas Generative design is:
 An iterative design process that involves a program that will generate a certain number of outputs that meet certain constraints.</p>
 
<p> This has gotten me to question the difference between generative design and parametric design as the two web definition have similar meaning. Through some quick research I was able to get this answer: "Parametric design allows thte designer to make changes in real-time. It allows them to rescue elements and parts in many projects. Generative design on the other hand, delivers solutions in iterations. The AI algorithm uses the input metrics to seperate good features from the bad." </p>

<p> Once I have gotten a basic understanding of the two concept, I have looked into few artists that we discussed in class with Karen. Some of the artworks that interested me are face profiling by Zach Blas and parametric typography. If my skills are advanced later on, I would like to create something similar based on their work. I'm interested in both social design or visual aesthetically pleasing design that are interactive with the user.

<h1> 

week 5 Pitch Presentation 

</h1> 

 <h3> 

Interactive Kinetic Typography 

</h3> 

<p>Like everyone else, I was very nervous about presenting my pitch especially when I realised I had internet issues during my presentation. But thankfully, Karen and Andy have been very understanding with the situation, so I was able to continue without much hesitation. </p> 

<p> My pitch is an Immersive Kinetic typography that allows patrons to interact with my installation. Originally, I was planning to create this for pure aesthetic purpose. However, after the break group that I joined previously, I had changed my mind to create something that has a purpose. As a result, I have decided to raise awareness for COVID-19. </p> 

<p> This pitch is most likely to be altered in many ways. In fact, I might create a new project that is not based on raising awareness of COVID-19 but something that makes people to work together have fun. </p>

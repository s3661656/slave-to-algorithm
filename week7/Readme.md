<p>This week, I have played used typography from the tutorial I have presented on week 5. I have focused on the kinectic typography to analyse the movement</p>

<h3> Pseudo Code</h3> 
<p>EXAMPLE 1
  <br> "coffee" 
<br> INT time 
<br> If time is >9pm, then don't make coffee 
<br> If time is 9pm<, then make coffee </br></p>

<p>EXAMPLE 2
  <br> Function HAND TRACKING 
<br> INPUT hand tracking 
<br> INPUT particles
<br>IF hand is detected; activate particle movement
<br>IF hand is not detected; RETURN</br> </p>

<p> INPUT hand tracking
<br> If hand gets closer than >100; steer particles away from hand
<br> if hand is closed; then particles flock to hand</br> </p>

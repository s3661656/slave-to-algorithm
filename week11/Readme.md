<p>During class, Karen gave me a solution that could possibly work. I think it had something to do with the font, so i used Karen's DIN_otf file instead to get it working. During my break, I have finished my basic coding that will be used on my final work. There's been a lot of failures and complications in classbut I think I am able to produce a piece that is functional. I would just like to fix few things that would be different from Daniel's tutorial. I aam hoping to use flocking technique, add colours and change the velocity. It really would have been great if i am able to input my hand tracking instead of a computer mouse, but I don't want to have regrets on things I can't do due to technical issue.</p>

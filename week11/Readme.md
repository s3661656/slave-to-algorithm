<p>the link below shows my work progress I have made.

<p>During class, Karen gave me a solution that could possibly work. I think it had something to do with the font, so i used Karen's DIN_otf file instead to get it working. During my break, I have finished my basic coding that will be used on my final work. There's been a lot of failures and complications in classbut I think I am able to produce a piece that is functional. I would just like to fix few things that would be different from Daniel's tutorial. I aam hoping to use flocking technique, add colours and change the velocity. It really would have been great if i am able to input my hand tracking instead of a computer mouse, but I don't want to have regrets on things I can't do due to technical issue.</p>

<h3>Inspiration and interesting finds</h3>

<p>This is all found from a youtube named "interactive developer" he is a korean interactive developer who shows his coding live so others can learn from his work. He was previously working for google and he has a lot of notable work that is very interesting other than interactive type he had created like above. I was almost sad to only find out about him now because he has done a lot of interesting projects. The only downside to his tutorials are for novice developers who are used to coding. So I wuld reccommend his work to people who are comfortable doing coding. Here's a link for those who are interested: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdeWxKJuvtUG2xyN6pOJEvA</p>

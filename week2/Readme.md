<head>week 2 observation</head>
<p> In week 2, wwe went through everyone's 12hour challenge and went through different type of algorithm that can be done in our everyday life.</p>
<p> on the 2nd part of our class, we learned a new software named processing. In this software we created basic shapes, colours and interactive commands so we are more used to coding. Once we have gotten used to using this software, we were able to create our faces.</p>
<p> Once we created our faces, we were to remix our design with other students and come up with unconventional designs that is possibly interactive for the users.</p>

<h1>week 2 observation</h1>
<p> In week 2, wwe went through everyone's 12hour challenge and went through different type of algorithm that can be done in our everyday life.</p>
<p> Here is my example of 12 hour challenge called "work or nap"</p>

<p>In week 2 we have discussed some of the notable artists and also mentioned Daniel Shiffman's 'The coding Train' for resourceful processing resources. 
  Some of the artists that has been mentioned are: Yoko Ono, Sol Lewitt, Raven Kwok, Nam June Paik and Manfred Mohr.</p>
  <p> From today's class Yoko Ono and Nam June Paik has caught my attention so I have decided to look a little further</p>
  <p> Yoko Ono is a Japanese-American multimedia artist, singer, songwriter and peace activist. Her most notable work consists of 'Half a room' and 'Snow Piece' . Half a room artwork that is "highly influenced by Marcel Duchamp and Conceptualism, Ono became interested in using domestic household objects to provide visual representation for her poetic imagination. In 1969, she created the installation Half a Room as a response to waking up to find that her former boyfriend Anthony Cox had disappeared from her flat. It simply contained a chair, a suitcase, and a space heater, each slashed in half and painted white as a visual representation of the rupture of breakup and heartbreak that is both palpable and touching." A lot of her work is conceptual and comes from her life experiences that is able to communicate with her audience. I think her work might be the definition of 'sublime aesthetic' that Karen was talking about earlier in class.

<p>Lastly, in today's class we learned a new software named processing. In this software we created basic shapes, colours and interactive commands so we are more used to coding. Once we have gotten used to using this software, we were able to create our faces.</p>
<p> Once we created our faces, we were to remix our design with other students and come up with unconventional designs that is possibly interactive for the users. The example is below:</p>

<head>Week 1 observation</head>
<p> In week 1, we learned the concept of generative and parametric design.
 Karen used breakfast/smoothie as an example to explain the parametres and the system of everyday life </p>
 
 <p>Some of the artworks that interested me are face profiling by Zach Blas and parametric typography. If my skills are advanced later on, I would like to create
 something similar based on their work. I'm interested in both social design or visual aesthetically pleasing design that are interactive with the user.</p>
 
<p> Unfortunately, I had to leave during the group activity due to personal reason. But thankfully, Karen has posted what we did during the group project. So I was able to get
 a rough idea on where the class is up to.</p>

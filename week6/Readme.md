Group Work 

</h3> 

<p>Yasmin, Hun and I became a group to do paper prototyping. Unfortunately, I was not able to turn my camera on due to technical difficulty, I later found out its due to my changed privacy settings on my Macbook when it was updating last time. Anyway, for our game we chose 'Sonic + knuckles and sonic the Hedgehog 3' to create a paper prototype. </p> 

<p>Here are some of the examples that we've been working as a team</p> 

<p> Later on, for our processing workshop we have learned how to use p5.js on how to add sounds </p>

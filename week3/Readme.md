week 3 observation
</h2>

<p>This week we had the opportunity to discover off-screen generative work without using coding and processing while still employing a rule-based system.</p>
<p> This week's activity was based on exploration of creating a drawing machine by using the items that's in our surroundings. Initally, I was planning to tie multiple paintbrush and use fan as the force variable to create a drawing machine. But unfortunately, our fans were packed in the garage so I had to come up with a different solution. This is when I laid my eyes on my teabag that was left from the tea I was drinking. </p>
<p> In the end, I used the same concept except relplaced the paintbrush to teabag and fan to hairdryer to create my drawing machine. It wasn't as creative as other students' wrok but i think it was a simple yet effective method to get the desired result to the given task. THe only thing I wish I could have done better in this activity is using a different teabag that produces different colours so I can create a more colourful drawing instead of stained looking paper.</p>
<p> Overall, I thought this was an interesting way of approaching the human/nature collaboration without having to use complicated coding. After this activity, we continued week 2's INPUT/OUTPUT sheet. But this time we looked into processing that comes between the input and output. This allowed each group to think critically and discuss the possiblities of what the processing might have been. </p>
<h2> Possible Projects </h2>
<p> I haven't exactly decided on what I want to create but I am currently intrested in creating a genereative typography similar to the idea of MIT logo. But I would like to try and create a intereactive set of typofaces. But that is just a thought I have for the moment. </p>

<h1> week 8 </h1> 
<h3> Trial and Error  </h3> 
<p>This week, my XBOX 360 Kinect has been delivered, so I have finally tried out one of the tutorials from "The Coding Train" </p> 

<p>Here are some of the examples of the following tutorials</p>

<p> Some of the biggest error I had encountered are technical issues. Before I began using kinect, I have attempted to use webcam on processing on my Macbook since my desktop doesn't have one. But it seems like my updated version of Macbook Pro cannot use Capture Video on processing. This error has been listed on other github pages. Here is a link: https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/134</p> 
<p> Another problem I have encountered was initDevice() does not function with Kinect(v1); https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing/issues/82;</p> 

<h3>Research</h3>

<br>In this essay, I was able to discover more on the possibilities of computer vision. This essay defines "Computer vision" as to a broad class of algorithms that allow computers to make intelligent assertions about digital images and video. In order to use complicated interactive art using computer vision, the essay provides elementary computer vision techniques to start off with.
  <li>-detecting motion</li>
  <li>-detecting presence</li>
  <li>-Detection through brightness thresholding</li>
  <li>-Simple object tracking</li>
  <li>-Basic Interactions</li>

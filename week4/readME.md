<h1>week 4 observation</h2>

<p>In week 4, we continued learning Processing. We focused on importing images and type. My favourite part of today’s learning is creating a kinetic type. Although I couldn’t take complete control of it, I feel like I can play with this coding and create something more interesting. </p>
<p> For my pitch, I’m thinking of creating a kinetic typography design. But if it’s possible, I do want to create an immersive installation that allows people to interact with my project. So far, I was able to find few projects that makes my hypothetical project possible with the help of standalone Kinect sensor.</p>

<p>Learning a new skill has always been difficult but coding has been the most difficult skill to pick up. There are so many times when I thought I was not going to cut it in this class and I was so afraid to show up in class because I felt so behind compared to others. Which I really regret, now that I think back. There's been a lot of stress and tears trying to understand coding that is behind every digital art. But hey I made it and it's over. It might not be the best work but I'm happy that I made it through my semester and I'm happy that I've tried to learn coding with the help of this class. Now I know how developers feel when they have to create an interactive web or something else. I think I might keep this github so I can still use some of this class resource to remake my project. Also, I might come back to Karen's github so I could refresh my memories. </p>
